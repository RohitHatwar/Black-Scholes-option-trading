## 💡 Project Summary

This project is an **interactive financial application** built using **Python** and **Streamlit**, designed to compute and visualize option pricing using the **Black-Scholes Model**. It also computes all essential **Greeks** and provides **heatmaps** to understand price behavior over varying market conditions.

This project showcases my core competencies in:

- Quantitative finance modeling  
- Python programming  
- Data visualization  
- UI/UX design for data applications  
- Deployment-ready analytical tools  

It serves as a complete demonstration of both **financial acumen** and **technical proficiency**—ideal for data analyst, quant, fintech, or investment research roles.

## 📂 Project Structure

* BlackScholes.py
-Core implementation of Black-Scholes pricing model
* main.py
-Streamlit dashboard with interactive features
* streamlit.py
-Duplicate or modified variant of main app



## 🚀 Features

### ✔️ Options Pricing using Black-Scholes Model
- Computes **Call** and **Put** option prices
- Inputs: Spot Price, Strike Price, Time to Maturity, Volatility, Risk-Free Rate

### ✔️ Greeks Calculation
- Delta (Call/Put)
- Gamma
- Vega
- Theta (Call/Put)
- Rho (Call/Put)

### ✔️ Interactive Streamlit Dashboard
- **Live input** for financial parameters
- Attractive layout with **custom CSS styling**
- Clean display of results with color-coded cards

### ✔️ Heatmap Visualization
- 2D heatmaps showing impact of **volatility** and **spot price** on option prices
- Great for **scenario analysis** and **sensitivity visualization**
